# Installation

- You'll need a Fabric account, so [sign up or sign in](https://fabric.io/sign_up).
- Fabric has an intricate on-boarding process. It's great if you want get Fabric running on an existing iOS or Android app, but if you just want to use web... well, you may need to build an iOS or Android project anyway just to get "on-boarded" by Fabric and gain access to Digits.
